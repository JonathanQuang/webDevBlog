Changes between initial design and the final project:
Aside from some minor variable and file renames, 
here are the changes:

Initial: Database of posts had two fields
Final: Database of posts have three fields, the extra
being postID due do the issue of having the same
text in different posts

Initial:No utils folder
Final: We created a utils folder to store our database
python functions because we quickly realized just
how messay the blog.py file was becoming. It also
allowed two people to work simultaneously on python
(well as simultaneous as github allows).

Initial: No Styling 
Final: Use of inline css from Bootstrap tutorial website
We decided to put at least some effort into making it 
look nice.
